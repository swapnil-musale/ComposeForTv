# ComposeForTv Template

# Purpose :
In Oct 2022 Jetpack Compose team extended support to develop app's for Android TV using Compose, Currently Compose for TV API are in alpha stage.
Right now Android Studio Flamingo Patch 2 version doesn't support to create TV App using Jetpack Compose and after creating XML TV project we have to do some changes to make it align with compose project.

Using this template with one click you can build awesome project in Compose.
